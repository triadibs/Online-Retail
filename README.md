# Online-Retail
# Project Overview

In this project, I developed a dashboard for an online retail store to analyze its performance and key business metrics. The goal was to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity. Using data visualization, the dashboard highlights crucial patterns in revenue, customer retention, and product sales. Key features include graphs for the top 10 countries by revenue, top 10 best-selling products, the percentage of returning customers, and monthly sales performance trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before conducting a full analysis, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset better:

- **Data Cleaning**: The data had missing values, duplicates, and anomalies (e.g., negative quantities in sales, incorrect customer IDs). I handled these by removing or correcting them where necessary.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics were computed for variables like revenue, customer count, and product quantities sold to understand their distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms and bar charts were used to understand the distribution of sales across countries and products, and line charts for monthly sales trends.

## Data Analysis

1. **Top 10 Countries**: Using sales data, I identified the top 10 countries contributing the most to revenue. This provides insight into geographic market performance.
2. **Top 10 Products**: I analyzed product sales to determine the top 10 best-selling products, giving an understanding of product popularity and demand.
3. **Returning Customer Percentage**: I calculated that 75% of customers were returning buyers, offering a strong indication of customer loyalty and satisfaction.
4. **Monthly Sales Performance**: I analyzed the monthly sales revenue and found a significant increase from August 2011 to November 2011, where sales peaked.

## Findings/Results

1. **Top 10 Countries**: The majority of revenue came from a small set of countries, with the UK dominating sales, followed by other European nations. ![Top 10 Country](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89dcb298-e4b8-46cb-ade5-27a0fcd13567)

3. **Returning Customers**: With 75% of customers making repeat purchases, customer loyalty is strong. This indicates the store's success in maintaining customer satisfaction and suggests that enhancing retention strategies could further boost profitability.![Returning Customer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6239a006-f01f-4718-b664-3e91547cd651)

4. **Monthly Sales Performance**: Sales saw a substantial rise from August 2011 to November 2011, with November being the peak month. This trend may suggest a build-up to holiday or seasonal sales, highlighting the importance of planning for demand spikes during this period.![Revenue by Month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83f6d60-ea3d-49a3-8770-9b7a70d97c6f)


## Recommendations

1. **Target High Revenue Countries**: Focus marketing efforts on the top-performing countries to boost sales further.
2. **Promote Best-Selling Products**: Increase marketing and promotional efforts around top-selling products to maximize revenue.
3. **Customer Retention**: With 75% of customers being repeat buyers, enhancing loyalty programs, email marketing, or discounts for returning customers could further increase repeat purchases and long-term customer value.
4. **Prepare for Seasonal Demand**: Given the significant rise in sales from August to November, plan inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies ahead of peak sales periods to fully capitalize on increased demand.
